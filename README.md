# nodejs-poolController - Version 8.1

## What is nodejs-poolController

nodejs-poolController is an application to communicate and control your Pentair compatible pool equipment.

 * Want to include a low cost controller for your pool?
 * Want a web interface for your system?
 * Want to turn your pumps on remotely?
 * Want to have your home automation system talk to your pool?
 * Want to control your pumps or chlorinator without a pool controller?

Equipment supported
1. Controllers:  IntelliCenter, Intellitouch, EasyTouch, Nixie (standalone equimpent), Aqualink
1. Pumps: Intelliflow VS/VSF/VF, older models, relay controlled pumps, Whisperflo
1. Chlorinators: Intellichlor, Aqua-Rite and OEM brands
1. Heaters: Gas, solar, heatpump
1. Intellichem and Relay Equipment Manager (REM) chemical controllers
1. Intellivalve (coming soon)
1. Home Automation:  SmartThings, Hubitat, ISY, Vera, Siri, Echo
1. Chemical probes (pH, ORP, flow sensors, EC, etc.)

## Latest Changes
See [Changelog](https://github.com/tagyoureit/nodejs-poolController/blob/master/Changelog)

## What's new in 8.1?

Support for dual chlorinators with REM chem controllers.  It is now possible to have two separate chlorinators controlled in 'dynamic' mode by two separate REM chems.  Note: In order for REM chem to control each chlorinator, each needs to be on a dedicated RS-485 port (not shared with an OCP or any other chlorinator).

## What's new in 8.0?

Screenlogic can now be used as a direct connection point.  If you feel that integrating an RS-485 adapter is a bit too much, then this is an option for you.  The preferred method is still RS-485 as it is more fully featured.

## What's new in 7.0?

The current version includes very tight intergation with [relayEquipmentManager](https://github.com/rstrouse/relayEquipmentManager) which allows for hardware control over your ancillary pool equipment (chemical probes, pumps, tanks, heaters, pumps, etc).  

Starting with this version, all code will immediately be pushed to `master` branch.  The version of a `next` branch for feature development will disappear.

## Installation Instructions

This code requires a physical [RS485](https://github.com/tagyoureit/nodejs-poolController/wiki/RS-485-Adapter-Details) adapter to work.

This is only the server code.  See [clients](#module_nodejs-poolController--clients) below for web or other ways to read/control the pool equipment. 

### Prerequisites
If you don't know anything about NodeJS, these directions might be helpful.

1. Install Nodejs (v20+ required). (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. Update NPM (https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).
1. It is recommended to clone the source code as updates are frequently pushed while releases are infrequent
   clone with `git clone https://github.com/tagyoureit/nodejs-poolController.git`
   (Alternate - not recommended - Download the latest [code release](https://github.com/tagyoureit/nodejs-poolController/releases)
1. Change directory into nodejs-poolController.
1. Run `npm install` in the new folder (where package.json exists).  This will automatically install all the dependencies (serial-port, express, sockets.io, etc).
1. Run the app with `npm start`.
   * `npm start` will compile the Typescript code.  You should use this every time you download/clone/pull the latest code.
   * `npm run start:cached` will run the app without compiling the code which can be much faster.
1. Install a [webclient](module_nodejs-poolController--clients) for a browser experience and/or a [binding](module_nodejs-poolController--bindings) to have two way control with Home Automation systems.

For a very thorough walk-through, see [this](https://www.troublefreepool.com/threads/pentair-intellicenter-pool-control-dashboard-instructional-guide.218514/) great thread on Trouble Free Pool.  Thanks @MyAZPool.

#### Upgrade Instructions
Assuming you cloned the repo, the following are easy steps to get the latest version:
1. Change directory to the njsPC app
2. `git pull`
3. `npm i` (not always necessary, but if dependencies are upgraded this will bring them up to date)
4. Start application as normal, or if using `npm run start:cached` then run `npm run build` to compile the code.

### Docker instructions

See the [wiki](https://github.com/tagyoureit/nodejs-poolController/wiki/Docker). Thanks @wurmr @andylippitt @emes.

### Automate startup of app
See the [wiki](https://github.com/tagyoureit/nodejs-poolController/wiki/Automatically-start-at-boot---PM2-&-Systemd).

# Clients & Bindings
To do anything with this app, you need a client to connect to it.  A client can be a web application or Home Automation system.

<a name="module_nodejs-poolController--clients"></a>

## REM (Relay Equipment Manager)
[Relay Equipment Manager](https://github.com/rstrouse/relayEquipmentManager) is a companion app developed by @rstrouse that integrates standalone hardware control.  Controls GPIO, i2c, and SPI devices including:
* Atlas Scientific pH, orp, ec, hum, prs, pmp, rtd
* ADS1x15 a/d converters
* Pressure Tranducers
* Flow sensors
* Temperature sensors (10k, NTC)

## Web Clients
1. [nodejs-poolController-dashPanel](https://github.com/rstrouse/nodejs-poolController-dashPanel).  Full compatibility with IntelliCenter, *Touch, REM (RelayEquipmentManager).

# Config.json changes

## Controller section - changes to the communications for the app
Most of these can be configured directly from the UI in dashPanel.
* `rs485Port` - set to the name of you rs485 controller.  See [wiki](https://github.com/tagyoureit/nodejs-poolController/wiki/RS-485-Adapter-Details) for details and testing.
* `portSettings` - should not need to be changed for RS485
* `mockPort` - opens a "fake" port for this app to communicate on.  Can be used with [packet captures/replays](https://github.com/tagyoureit/nodejs-poolController/wiki/How-to-capture-all-packets-for-issue-resolution).
* `netConnect` - used to connect via [Socat](https://github.com/tagyoureit/nodejs-poolController/wiki/Socat)
  * `netHost` and `netPort` - host and port for Socat connection.
* `inactivityRetry` - # of seconds the app should wait before trying to reopen the port after no communications.  If your equipment isn't on all the time or you are running a virtual controller you may want to dramatically increase the timeout so you don't get console warnings.

## Web section - controls various aspects of external communications
* `servers` - setting for different servers/services
 * `http2` - not used currently
 * `http` - primary server used for api connections without secure communications
    * `enabled` - self-explanatory
    * `ip` - The ip of the network address to listen on.  Default of `127.0.0.1` will only listen on the local loopback (localhost) adapter.  `0.0.0.0` will listen on all network interfaces.  Any other address will listen exclusively on that interface.
    * `port` - Port to listen on.  Default is `4200`.
    * `httpsRedirect` - Redirect http traffic to https
    * `authentication` - Enable basic username/password authentication.  (Not implemented yet.)
    * `authFile` - Location of the encrypted password file.  By default, `/users.htpasswd`. If you have `authentication=1` then create the file users.htpasswd in the root of the application.  Use a tool such as http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/ and paste your user(s) into this file.  You will now be prompted for authentication.
 * `https` - See http options above.
    * `sslKeyFile` - Location of key file
    * `sslCertFile` - Location of certificate file
 * `mdns` - Not currently used.
 * `ssdp` - Enable for automatic configuration by the webClient and other platforms.


## Log - Different aspects of logging to the application
 * `app` - Application wide settings
    * `enabled` - Enable/disable logging for the entire application
    * `level` - Different levels of logging from least to most: 'error', 'warn', 'info', 'verbose', 'debug', 'silly'
* `packet` - Configuration for the
